This repository contains a C# code example demonstrating a potential bug in a simple calculation function. The function `Calculate` is designed to divide two integers, but it prematurely returns 0 if either input is 0. This can lead to unexpected results or exceptions if both `a` and `b` are 0. The solution provided addresses this by handling the case of a and b being 0 individually.
